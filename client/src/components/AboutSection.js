      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University at Buffalo with a strong foundation in software development and a passion for creating innovative solutions. My project experience spans application development in Scala, Python, and Go, along with game development in Unreal Engine 5. To complement my technical abilities, I have honed my leadership skills as a Production Technical Director, successfully guiding teams to deliver high-quality results in fast-paced event environments. I am eager to apply my technical knowledge and collaborative spirit to a challenging software engineering role. 
        <br></br> <br></br>On a personal note, photography is one of my greatest hobbies. I invite you to enjoy some of my favorite photos, featured alongside my projects below.
